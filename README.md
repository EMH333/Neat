# Neat

A application that for most users returns a JSON list of neat stuff as added by the maintainer. Maintainer can go to `/add` to add "Neat Stuff" and the api is accesible at `/json`.

Can be run using `go build main.go && ./main`. If you want to change the port, just add that as a command line argument (`./main 1234`).
